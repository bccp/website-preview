<p>The main focus of my research is physical cosmology, a worldwide effort
to explain the inner workings of our universe on its largest scales in
terms of physics that we know, understand, and love. In particular,
cosmological observations now show that in addition to the matter
present in the standard model of particle physics, the universe is
filled with two extra components: dark matter and dark energy. Dark
matter is a component that is coupled to known matter and fields
gravitationally, but does not interact significantly through any other
force. Luckily, theorists are able produce many ideas of what this
elusive dark matter particle could be, and some will be tested soon at
the Large Hadron Collider in Cern. Dark Energy is an even more
mysterious component. It is a smooth, invisible component that drives
the recent acceleration of the universe. Its energy scale is different
to understand within the context of the standard model of particle
physics. Nevertheless, we have now seen it in many different
cosmological probes. Some theoretical physicists think that the
existence of dark energy in terms of vacuum energy is most natural and
should be expected, while others think it is the strangest thing they
have ever encountered. My job as a cosmologist (in working at the
interface between theory and experiment) is to work around various
astrophysical and observational limitations to extract the maximum
amount of information from the available observational data. Following
is a short description of research that I am currently pursuing. Most of
my research is done with collaborators, too numerous to cite.</p>
<div class="section" id="lyman-alpha-forest">
<h2>Lyman Alpha Forest</h2>
<div class="figure align-right" style="width: 40%">
<img alt="/images/anze-slosar/lyman.jpg" src="../../images/anze-slosar/lyman.jpg"><p class="caption">HIRES Spectrum of HS 0105+1619. The messy stuff left to the Lyman-Alpha
peak at around 4450 Angstroms is the forest.</p>
</div>
<p>Light from distant quasars is absorbed by the neutral hydrogen atoms
along the line of sight. This produces a characteristic structure in
the spectra of quasars that we call Lyman Alpha Forest. By studying
the statistical properties of these spectra we can infer the
statistics of the underlying matter distribution. This can in turn be
used to constrain various parameters of the cosmological model, most
importantly properties of neutrinos (very important subatomic
particles), the details about how the inflation took place and early
dark energy. In particular, I am focused on measuring the 3-point
statistics also known as bi-spectrum.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="supernova-data">
<h2>Supernova data</h2>
<div class="figure align-right" style="width: 20%">
<img alt="/images/anze-slosar/snov.jpg" src="../../images/anze-slosar/snov.jpg"><p class="caption">A supernova bursting off at the outskirts of NGC 4526 (High-Z Supernova
Search Team/HST/NASA)</p>
</div>
<p>Supernovae act as standard candles, which allow us to use them to
measure the expansion history of the universe. I have not only used
supernovae to constrain cosmology in some of my parameter estimation
ventures, but have also done research on the effect of their peculiar
velocities. Coherent motions in the universe produce coherent
perturbations on the supernovae luminosities, allowing one to probe
perturbations in the universe while at the same time reducing our
ability to probe the background expansion of the universe. With
collaborators from Oxford, we were first to measure this effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="large-scale-structure-data">
<h2>Large Scale Structure data</h2>
<div class="figure align-right" style="width: 15%">
<img alt="/images/anze-slosar/NGC5428_2.jpg" src="../../images/anze-slosar/NGC5428_2.jpg"><p class="caption">NGC 5248, a spiral galaxy much like the Milky Way. Image courtesy the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.</p>
</div>
<p>Large Scale Structure data is an umbrella term covering measurements
of clustering properties of objects in the universe. These include
data from "nearby" galaxies from the redshift surveys, such as SDSS
and 2dF, as well as measurements of correlation properties of luminous
red galaxies (LRG) and quasi-stellar objects (QSO or quasars). I have
recently been involved in a project to determine the amount of local
non-Gaussianity using the scale dependent bias of these probes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cosmic-microwave-background">
<h2>Cosmic Microwave Background</h2>
<img alt="/images/anze-slosar/array.jpg" class="align-left" src="../../images/anze-slosar/array.jpg" style="height: 100px;"><p>The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the relic radiation
emitted about 400,000 years after the Big Bang and contains a plethora
of information about our universe, its contents, and geometry. It is the
most important and clean cosmological probe available to us. I was
involved in measurements of the CMB fluctuations as a graduate student
working with the Very Small Array (VSA). I have published more papers on
various aspects of the CMB and WMAP, including work on the famous axis
of evil (claimed correlation between hydrogen and CMB spots) and our
ability to measure difference in neutrino masses from the CMB.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="neutrinos-and-other-thermal-relics">
<h2>Neutrinos and other thermal relics</h2>
<img alt="/images/anze-slosar/neutrino.gif" class="align-left" src="../../images/anze-slosar/neutrino.gif" style="height: 100px;"><p><em>Shown at left: A plot
showing suppression in the power spectrum of matter fluctuations for
three equally massive neutrinos (dotted) and one massive and 2 light
neutrinos (dashed). Solid line shows a massless neutrino case.</em> The early
history of the universe is a beautiful probe of basic physics, because
it very simple: it is hot and homogeneous and therefore its state is
completely described by one parameter: temperature. By calculating how
the universe cools and how various particles condense in this process,
we are able to put very strong limits on various fundamental particles,
such as neutrinos, thermalized warm dark matter particles, axions, and
similar species.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="galaxy-zoo">
<h2>Galaxy Zoo</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://galaxyzoo.org/">Galaxy Zoo</a> is a project to harness the
power of the internet to morphologically classify nearly a million
galaxies from the SDSS catalogue. I was a member of the core team since
the inception of the project. Response from the public has been
astonishing - over 100 thousands individuals registered to participate
and we have an average of over 30 classifications per galaxy. Scientific
results are quite exciting as well and we are publishing results very
soon.</p>
